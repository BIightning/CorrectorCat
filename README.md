The concept of “Corrector Cat” follows the idea of constructivist learning. The player must develop
an own perspective on reading fluency by distinguishing between fluent and non-fluent reading. The
game is based on a learning by teaching approach. The main goal is to identify and classify mistakes
which are made while reading out loud.

The player reads and simultaneously listens to a text, which is shown on the screen. The
text, which is read aloud features reading mistakes. Those mistakes are played randomly between
passages of fluent reading. The player must recognize the mistake and in addition, he must classify
it by selecting one out of six error types. For every correctly found mistake, the player gains points
as well as for classifying them.

Only a few texts are available at the beginning of the game. By collecting points, the player
can unlock more stories with different lengths and levels of difficulties. After finishing a story, the
player must complete a short questionnaire. It includes questions about the content of the presented
story. By answering the questions correctly, the player also gets points.

“Corrector Cat” is a single-player-game, which should lead to an individual and autonomous way of
improving reading fluency. With the help of this concept the reader should develop a mental model
of fluent reading. At the moment German- and English stories are available in the game. Furthermore,
the implementation of other languages is preferable.
